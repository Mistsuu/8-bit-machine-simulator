# Simple 8-bit machine compiler\
Based on the architecture of Ben Eater's 8-bit computer, and comeup with my own code word.\
(Pss.. If you have not check his videos, please check them!! Really well-explained!!)

<b>Files:</b>\
parser.cpp: compile my own home-brew assembly syntax into (also my own home-brew) machine code (actually, not really...) that could only be understood by run.cpp\
run.cpp: run the machine code, emulating it(can see the program state)

<b>How to use:</b>\
Compiling them with Dev-C++, in Windows environment, and you're ready to go!\
(Sorry, not for linux-heads :() (is there even such a word?, hmm)

<b>Sample assembly code:</b>\
Those files with ending .su (Mist"su"u, surpriseee) are those of my own test self-made-assembly codes.

<b>How to use (part 2):</b>\
You could compile them with the "parser" file.\
It will drop out a similar file with ".out" ending, and you use "run" file to run that!
